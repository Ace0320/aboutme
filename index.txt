I am currently a Junior completing my BS in Computer Science, I expect to graduate next spring term. I am also a Teaching Assistant for Programming II.

I am originally from a small town called Adams, Nebraska and in elementary moved to another small town that is Union Star, Missouri. I attended Union Star RII School until I graduated and started here at Northwest. While I was a freshman in high school, I took an online course that introduced me to the computer science field. This course taught me Visual Basic and Java. Ever since then it has been a hobby of mine to find things I could automate with my knowledge of programming.

I hope to be a Software Engineer and/or Software Developer. I always enjoyed creating applications and had fun trying to figure out how to make something work the way I wanted it to. I also enjoy it when I make something that someone else finds helpful for them.

I love to go night hiking with my fiance and friends. I also love playing games (be it video or board games) with them as well.
