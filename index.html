                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                I am currently a Junior completing my BS in Computer Science, I expect to graduate next spring
                term. I
                am also
                a
                Teaching Assistant for Programming II.

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                I am originally from a small town called Adams, Nebraska and in elementary moved to another small
                town
                that is
                Union Star, Missouri. I attended Union Star RII School until I graduated and started here at
                Northwest.
                While I
                was
                a freshman in high school, I took an online course that introduced me to the computer science
                field.
                This
                course
                taught me Visual Basic and Java. Ever since then it has been a hobby of mine to find things I could
                automate
                with
                my knowledge of programming.

                <h2>Hopes and Dreams</h2>
                I hope to be a Software Engineer and/or Software Developer. I always enjoyed creating applications
                and
                had fun
                trying to figure out how to make something work the way I wanted it to. I also enjoy it when I make
                something
                that
                someone else finds helpful for them.

                <h2>What I like</h2>
                I love to go night hiking with my fiance and friends. I also love playing games (be it video or
                board
                games)
                with
                them as well.
